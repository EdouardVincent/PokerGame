# PokerGame0.0.1

Hello eveybody,

As you can see, today I published an American poker game coded in Python. The reason why the game is not finished is because my computer works very bad and I was scared to lose all my programs. So, I decided to publish my game even the fact that it is not finished. You can check the code to see what does it look. It is probably the biggest project on python for me, so it will be very long for you to see the 0.0.2 version. In last, I wanted to tell you that I'm really involved in this project. I work with the last version of python 3.10.1 on Windows and Thonny Python IDLE on rpi4. my pygame's version is the 2.0.1.

See you later !
