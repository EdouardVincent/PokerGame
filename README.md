# PokerGame0.0.1

Hello eveybody,

As you can see, I published a American poker game coded in Python. The reason why the game is not finished is because my computer is work very bad and I was scraed to lose all my programs. So, I decided to publish my game even the fact that it is not finished. You can check the code to see what does it look. I work with python 3.9.5 on Windows and Thonny Python IDLE on rpi4. my pygame'sversion is the 2.0.1.

See you later !
